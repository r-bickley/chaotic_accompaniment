# chaotic_accompaniment
A musical accompaniment program that listens to what you play or sing, and tries its very best to play along.
Try the continuous mode with headphones or when the microphone and speaker are well-separated.
Try live mode for cases where you're using a single device for audio output and input (as in a laptop).
